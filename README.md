A chat app using Redux, Redux Saga, and WebSockets

A username is randomly generated when a user joins. Try opening multiple windows to test it out.

The backend is a WebSocket server hosted on Heroku free tier. The free tier dynos take a while to start up so it can be buggy.

Try opening a window, close it, and wait 30 seconds. Then the app should have started up and you can open multiple windows.




Plan so far:


Get Project looking good
  Good looking CSS from material UI
  Add headers
  Add submit button

Add Functionality
  Add database for storing messages
  Let users sign in, select username
  Add chatbot too
